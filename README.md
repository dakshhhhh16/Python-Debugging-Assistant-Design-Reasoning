# AI Python Debugging Mentor - Prompt Engineering Project

### Getting Started
Ready to transform any AI into a Python debugging mentor? Here's how:
1. Navigate to [`prompt.md`](./prompt.md) and grab the complete prompt
2. Drop it into your favorite AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
3. Share a student's Python code that needs debugging
4. Watch as the AI guides learning through strategic questions instead of giving direct answers
5. Students build real debugging skills while gaining confidence

## Project Overview
This repository showcases my approach to designing an AI prompt that teaches debugging through discovery rather than quick fixes. The complete solution includes:

1. **Ready-to-use prompt**: Find the core prompt in [`prompt.md`](./prompt.md) - just copy and deploy
2. **Design insights**: Explore my reasoning and educational philosophy in [`design_reasoning.md`](./design_reasoning.md)
3. **Real scenarios**: Check out practical demonstrations in [`examples.md`](./examples.md)

## Key Features
- ✅ **Socratic Teaching Method**: Guides students through questions, not answers
- ✅ **Skill-Level Adaptation**: Automatically adjusts complexity for beginners vs advanced learners
- ✅ **Confidence Building**: Maintains encouraging tone even when multiple bugs exist
- ✅ **Long-term Learning**: Focuses on teaching debugging strategies, not just fixing immediate problems
